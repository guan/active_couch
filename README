ActiveCouch aims to be an easy-to-use, familiar ORM library for the hot new kid on the block, CouchDB.

* Preliminarily,
- it will support ActiveRecord-esque functions such as find, create, save, etc.
- location of the CouchDB will be specified through a very simple class method called 'site' similar to ActiveResource.
- callbacks and observers (for example when to call upon saving of a new document)
- migrations to add views to a CouchDB server

* Nodes supported:
- String, Integer, Float (E.g. has :name)
- array (E.g. has_many :airports)

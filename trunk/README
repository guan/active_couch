ActiveCouch aims to be an easy-to-use, familiar ORM library for the hot new kid on the block, CouchDB.

Preliminarily,
- it will support ActiveRecord-esque functions such as find, create, save, etc.
- it will have a nice couch.yml with configuration pointing to the CouchDB server
- callbacks and observers (for example when to call upon saving of a new document)

* Nodes supported:
- text (E.g. text :name)
- array (E.g. array :airport_names - this will use the ActiveRecord convention and map to the camelized class name AirportName)

Nice to have extensions:
- schema.rb which will contain schemas for the ActiveCouch documents
- Migrations to change document schemas
